    "therapeuticArea": "oncology",
    "pipelineColour": "blue",
    "pipelineAssessment": "ESR1 is the 2019 Target Of The Year and has come back into focus based on research that modulating it may prevent aging. There is a Phase II clinical trial with ESTRADIOL and although results were mixed, it has sparked renewed interest in the gene and its approved drugs. As an oncogene, it has been implicated in a number of cancers and there are some biomarkers that have been identified that make drugs more responsive or resistant when treating breast adenocarcinoma."

Open Targets and ChEMBL both report that 8 drugs are undergoing clinical trials and that the gene is predicted tractable for both small molecule and antibody modalities. There are also more than 200 mouse phenotypes that have been observed in models where this gene has been knocked-down or knocked-out.",

Reactome has identified the role of this gene in 6 pathways, including the 'Insulin receptor signalling cascade' and 'Insulin receptor recycling' pathways. There are various versions of insulin that have been extensively tested in more than 1,000 Phase IV clinical trials.",

Although no drugs that modulate this gene are currently undergoing a clinical trial, Open Targets has assessed the tractability of this gene as 'Predicted Tractable - High Confidence' based on Gene Ontology location.",

ChEMBL has identified that there are two approved drugs that modulate this target - MIGLITOL and VOGLIBOSE. Open Targets has computed a strong assocation between this gene and cardiomyopathy based on very strong genetics and pathway evidence along with supporting drugs, animal model, and text mining data.",
